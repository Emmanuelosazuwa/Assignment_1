      Web Development Life Cycle - Web Development.In the process of Web
      Development, Developers build web pages and applications for either the
      Intranet, a private network, or the Internet. Web Development does not
      necessarily focus on a website’s design; rather, it is majorly concerned
      with the programming and coding part, which is the main reason for the
      functioning of the website.

      Systems Development Life Cycle. Programming Fundamentals.In systems
      engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems
      development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the application
      development life-cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, and
      deploying an information system.[1] The systems development life cycle
      concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a
      system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination
      of both.[2] There are usually six stages in this cycle: requirement
      analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation,
      and evaluation.

      Product Lifecycle Management: The term product life cycle refers to the
      length of time a product is introduced to consumers into the market until
      it's removed from the shelves. The life cycle of a product is broken into
      four stages—introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.

    <p>
      Construction projects are highly structured endeavors, whether that’s
      building a shopping mall or a single-dwelling residence. They have a lot
      of moving parts and people that must be precisely coordinated.

    <p>
      A Gantt chart is a project management tool assisting in the planning and
      scheduling of projects of all sizes, although they are particularly useful
      for simplifying complex projects. Project management timelines and tasks
      are converted into a horizontal bar chart, showing start and end dates, as
      well as dependencies, scheduling and deadlines, including how much of the
      task is completed per stage and who is the task owner. This is useful to
      keep tasks on track when there is a large team and multiple stakeholders
      when the scope changes.

    <h2>Project management</h2>
    <img src="images/Projectmanagement.jpg" alt="Project management image" />
    <p>
      Project management is the use of specific knowledge, skills, tools and
      techniques to deliver something of value to people.The development of
      software for an improved business process, the construction of a building,
      the relief effort after a natural disaster, the expansion of sales into a
      new geographic market—these are all examples of projects.

    <h2>Project management team</h2>
    <img src="images/projectteam.jpg" alt="Project team image" />
    <p>
      In a project, a project team or team is defined as "an interdependent
      collection of individuals who work together towards a common goal and who
      share responsibility for specific outcomes of their organizations". An
      additional requirement to the original definition is that "the team is
      identified as such by those within and outside of the team".As project
      teams work on specific projects, the first requirement is usually met. In
      the early stages of a project, the project team may not be recognized as a
      team, leading to some confusion within the organization. The central
      characteristic of project teams in modern organizations is the autonomy
      and flexibility availed in the process or method undertaken to meet their
      goals.
